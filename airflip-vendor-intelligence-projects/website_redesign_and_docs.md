# Airflip Website & Documentation Redesign

## Enhanced Product Messaging and Call-to-Actions
- Refined Messaging: I conducted a competitive analysis and applied a messaging framework to define Airflip's key benefits. I worked backwards from our Persona/Audience to understand their Use Case, Current Approach, and Problems. From there, I identified the most impactful features that address these problems. I refined the language at each step to ensure it resonates with prospects and quickly engages them.
- Workflow Videos: To highlight Airflip's features, I created a series of workflow videos and animated visuals using Screen Studio. These videos offer step-by-step demonstrations, making the platform's capabilities easy to understand and visually engaging.
- Improving Call-to-Actions: I optimized call-to-actions by revising button text, adjusting placement, and enhancing visual elements to make them more compelling and drive higher user engagement.

## Comprehensive Public Documentation
- Building a Robust Help Site: I developed a detailed documentation site hosted at [help.airflip.com](https://www.help.airflip.com) using Mintlify. This site includes in-depth product writeups and terminology guides, structured intuitively to address user needs and incorporate feedback to resolve common pain points.
- Integrated In-Product Links: Each help page is directly linked to the corresponding area of the platform, ensuring users can access relevant guidance seamlessly while using the product.
